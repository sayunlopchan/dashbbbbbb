# Image Upload System

## Overview
Images are now stored as files on the filesystem instead of binary data in MongoDB.

## Directory Structure
- `uploads/` - Directory where event images are stored
- Images are automatically created with unique filenames: `event-{timestamp}-{random}.{extension}`

## API Endpoints
- `POST /api/events` - Create event with images (max 3 images, 5MB each)
- `PUT /api/events/:eventId` - Update event with new images
- `GET /api/events/:eventId/images/:imageId` - Serve specific image
- `GET /uploads/{filename}` - Direct access to uploaded images

## Image Storage
- Images are stored in the `uploads/` directory
- File paths are stored in MongoDB instead of binary data
- Automatic cleanup when events are deleted
- Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF

## Security
- File type validation (images only)
- File size limit (5MB per file)
- Maximum 3 images per event
- Unique filename generation to prevent conflicts

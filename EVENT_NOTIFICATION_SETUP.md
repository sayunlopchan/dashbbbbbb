# Event Notification Email System

## Overview
The application now automatically sends event notification emails to all active members when a new event is created. This feature helps keep members informed about upcoming events and increases participation.

## How It Works

### 1. **Event Creation Trigger**
- **Location**: `src/services/event.service.js` - `createEventService` function
- **Trigger**: When a new event is successfully created and saved to the database
- **Action**: Automatically sends notification emails to all active members

### 2. **Member Selection**
The system sends emails to members with the following statuses:
- **Active members** (`memberStatus: 'active'`)
- **Expiring members** (`memberStatus: 'expiring'`)

Members with other statuses (pending, cancelled, expired) are excluded from notifications.

### 3. **Email Template**
- **Template**: `src/utils/emailTemplates/eventNotification.js`
- **Subject**: `ðŸŽ‰ New Event: [Event Title]`
- **Content**: 
  - Event details (title, organizer, category, location, dates)
  - Event description and tags
  - Call-to-action buttons
  - Professional styling with responsive design

### 4. **Email Sending Process**
- **Function**: `sendEventNotificationToAllMembers` in `src/utils/emailService.js`
- **Batch Processing**: Sends emails in batches of 10 to avoid overwhelming the email service
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling - email failures don't break event creation
- **Logging**: Detailed logging of success/failure rates

## Email Content

### **What Members Receive**
1. **Event Title** - Prominently displayed
2. **Event Details**:
   - Event ID
   - Organizer name
   - Category (fitness, competition, workshop, social, other)
   - Location
   - Start and end times (formatted)
3. **Event Description** - Full description as provided
4. **Event Tags** - Visual tag display
5. **Call-to-Action** - "View Event Details" button
6. **Next Steps** - Suggestions for what to do next

### **Email Features**
- **Responsive Design** - Works on mobile and desktop
- **Professional Styling** - Branded colors and layout
- **Clear Information Hierarchy** - Easy to scan and read
- **Action-Oriented** - Encourages member engagement

## Implementation Details

### **Service Layer**
```javascript
// In src/services/event.service.js
const createEventService = async (eventData, userId) => {
  // ... event creation logic ...
  
  // Send event notification to all active members
  try {
    const activeMembers = await Member.find({ 
      memberStatus: { $in: ['active', 'expiring'] }
    }).select('fullName email memberStatus');
    
    if (activeMembers.length > 0) {
      const emailResults = await sendEventNotificationToAllMembers(event, activeMembers);
      // Log results...
    }
  } catch (emailError) {
    // Handle email errors gracefully
  }
};
```

### **Email Service**
```javascript
// In src/utils/emailService.js
const sendEventNotificationToAllMembers = async (eventDetails, members) => {
  // Batch processing with error handling
  // Returns detailed results
};
```

## Configuration

### **Email Settings**
Uses the same email configuration as other email features:
- **SMTP Settings**: Configured in environment variables
- **Email Templates**: Located in `src/utils/emailTemplates/`
- **Error Handling**: Non-critical failures don't affect event creation

### **Member Filtering**
- **Included**: Active and expiring members
- **Excluded**: Pending, cancelled, expired members
- **Selection**: Only name and email fields are fetched for efficiency

## Performance Considerations

### **Batch Processing**
- **Batch Size**: 10 emails per batch
- **Delay**: 1-second delay between batches
- **Parallel Processing**: Emails within each batch are sent in parallel
- **Memory Efficient**: Only fetches necessary member data

### **Error Handling**
- **Non-Critical**: Email failures don't affect event creation
- **Detailed Logging**: Success/failure counts and error details
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to work even if email service is down

## Testing

### **Manual Testing**
1. Create a new event through the API
2. Check logs for email sending results
3. Verify emails are received by active members
4. Check email content and formatting

### **Error Testing**
1. Temporarily use invalid email credentials
2. Create an event - should succeed without emails
3. Check logs for email error messages

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
1. **No Emails Sent**: Check if there are active members in the database
2. **Email Failures**: Verify email configuration and SMTP settings
3. **Template Issues**: Check email template syntax and data formatting

### **Debug Information**
The system logs detailed information:
- Number of members found
- Email sending progress
- Success/failure counts
- Individual email errors

## Future Enhancements

### **Potential Improvements**
1. **Member Preferences**: Allow members to opt-out of event notifications
2. **Event Categories**: Send notifications only to members interested in specific categories
3. **Scheduled Sending**: Delay notifications for events far in the future
4. **Rich Content**: Include event images in emails
5. **Personalization**: Customize content based on member preferences

## Security Considerations
- **Email Addresses**: Only member names and emails are used
- **No Sensitive Data**: Event details are public information
- **Opt-Out Option**: Consider adding unsubscribe functionality
- **Rate Limiting**: Batch processing prevents email service abuse

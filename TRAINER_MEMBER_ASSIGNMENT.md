# Trainer-Member Assignment System

## Overview
The trainer-member assignment system now supports bidirectional assignment, ensuring data consistency between trainer and member records.

## How It Works

### When Assigning a Member to a Trainer
1. **From Trainer Side** (`/trainers/:trainerId/assign-member`):
   - Adds member to trainer's `assignedMembers` array
   - Updates member's `personalTrainer` field with trainer details
   - If member already has a different trainer, removes from old trainer first

2. **From Member Side** (`/members/:memberId/assign-trainer`):
   - Updates member's `personalTrainer` field
   - Adds member to trainer's `assignedMembers` array
   - If member already has a different trainer, removes from old trainer first

### When Removing a Member from a Trainer
1. **From Trainer Side** (`/trainers/:trainerId/members/:memberId`):
   - Removes member from trainer's `assignedMembers` array
   - Clears member's `personalTrainer` field

2. **From Member Side** (`/members/:memberId/remove-trainer`):
   - Clears member's `personalTrainer` field
   - Removes member from trainer's `assignedMembers` array

### When Updating Member Status
- Updates member status in trainer's `assignedMembers` array
- If status is set to "inactive", clears member's `personalTrainer` field

## Data Models

### Trainer Model
```javascript
assignedMembers: [
  {
    memberId: String,
    fullName: String,
    assignedDate: Date,
    status: "active" | "inactive"
  }
]
```

### Member Model
```javascript
personalTrainer: {
  trainerId: String,
  trainerFullName: String,
  assignedDate: Date
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Trainer Routes
- `POST /trainers/:trainerId/assign-member` - Assign member to trainer
- `DELETE /trainers/:trainerId/members/:memberId` - Remove member from trainer
- `PATCH /trainers/:trainerId/members/:memberId/status` - Update member status

### Member Routes
- `POST /members/:memberId/assign-trainer` - Assign trainer to member
- `DELETE /members/:memberId/remove-trainer` - Remove trainer from member

## Benefits
1. **Data Consistency**: Both trainer and member records stay synchronized
2. **Flexible Assignment**: Can assign from either trainer or member side
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Handles reassignment and removal automatically
4. **Transaction Safety**: Uses MongoDB transactions to ensure data integrity

## Error Handling
- Prevents duplicate assignments
- Handles missing trainer/member gracefully
- Provides clear error messages for validation failures
- Rolls back changes on errors using transactions
